## Proposal

Are you a nature enthusiast? Hiking on the trails, smelling the trees, listening to the chirp of the birds are the perfect way of your relaxation? Do you like exploring outdoors, but sometimes little hesitant to travel to a new place on your own?
```diff
+ Then Odyssey is for you.
+ It’s an app-based experience for nature scavenger hunt, where you can identify local species all while off the grid.
+ The app comes with your choice of difficulty level and option to play alone or in group.
```

## Target Users

While this app should be suitable for nearly anyone visiting a park with a smartphone, here are few specific target users:

## Implementation Approach
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Built on highly efficient publicly available vision model- TFHub Inception v3  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) 16-bit weight quantization is used to reduce the initial model size (to 45 mb) and inference time. It matches full model by 99.9%  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Data Augmentation used to take care of the cropped/ zoom/ rotated images.  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Class imbalance is handled through balanced batching and label smoothing.  
![](https://placehold.it/8/f03c15/000000?text=+) **Entire code is available** [here](https://github.com/Final-Capstone-Nature-Scavenger-Hunt/odyssee-app)

## Future Roadmap  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Field Testing  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Add more parks  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Expansion of hunts (e.g. wildflower expansion released in spring)  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Geolocating hot-spots for species [“keep your eyes peeled, there are a lot of black-tailed deer in this area”]  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Gray out items from list that are out of season  
![](https://placehold.it/8/32CD32/000000?text=+) Selective data augmentation by image type. [e.g. A pinecone may appear in any orientation but a deer or tree won’t appear upside down]
