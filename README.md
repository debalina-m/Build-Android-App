## Proposal

Are you a nature enthusiast? Hiking on the trails, smelling the trees, listening to the chirp of the birds are the perfect way of your relaxation? Do you like exploring outdoors, but sometimes little hesitant to travel to a new place on your own?
```diff
+ Then Odyssey is for you.
+ It’s an app-based experience for nature scavenger hunt, where you can identify local species all while off the grid.
+ The app comes with your choice of difficulty level and option to play alone or in group.
```

## Problem Statement

![](https://placehold.it/15/32CD32/000000?text=+)  Interaction with nature delivers measurable benefits to physical health, mental health, cognitive ability and social cohesion. It is also associated with conservation behavior such as recycling.  
US National Parks are visited more than 300M times per year, but many non-visitors cite too little info about what to do inside and a preference for electronic activities as reasons for not visiting more.  
In addition, only 40% of Americans consider enjoying nature an important aspect of a vacation.  
So the objective of this Odyssee app is help making the experience of visiting a national park more fun, exciting, challenging and memorable. 

## Target Users

While this app should be suitable for nearly anyone visiting a park with a smartphone, here are few specific target users:
