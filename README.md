## Proposal

Are you a nature enthusiast? Hiking on the trails, smelling the trees, listening to the chirp of the birds are the perfect way of your relaxation? Do you like exploring outdoors, but sometimes little hesitant to travel to a new place on your own?
```diff
+ Then Odyssey is for you. It’s an app-based experience for nature scavenger hunt, where you can identify local species, and iconic landscapes, all while off the grid.
The app comes with your choice of difficulty level and option to play alone or in group.
```
So install Odyssee the next time you are visiting a national park and take the challenge.  
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  The initial phase is being launched for **Yosemite National Park**.

## Problem Statement

![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  Interaction with nature delivers measurable benefits to physical health, mental health, cognitive ability and social cohesion. It is also associated with conservation behavior such as recycling.  
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  US National Parks are visited more than 300M times per year, but many non-visitors cite too little info about what to do inside and a preference for electronic activities as reasons for not visiting more.  
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  In addition, only 40% of Americans consider enjoying nature an important aspect of a vacation.
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  So the objective of this Odyssee app is help making the experience of visiting a national park more fun, exciting, challenging and memorable. 

## Target Users

While this app should be suitable for nearly anyone visiting a park with a smartphone, here are few specific use cases:
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  Friends Reunion
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  Educational Excursion
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  Families Reconnecting
![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/8/008000/000000?text=+)  People Needing Instruction

## Data

<img src="https://github.com/Final-Capstone-Nature-Scavenger-Hunt/Nature-Scavenger-Hunt/blob/master/Media/data.png" alt="OdysseeData" width="150px" height="120px">
- Most of the data used would be generated within the project itself
- Reference Weed Identification images
- UC weed photo library
- Weed Alert (need to verify images are open source)
- Weed Science Society of America
- Possible data science techniques
- CNN (for weed recognition/classification within the unit)
- Pub/Sub data handling (MQTT)
- General IoT activity of edge sensors feeding central analytic systems.
- Reporting and visualization (D3 (or C3 or Chart.js)) visualizations

## Related research/products

- Wheeled “smart weeders” noted above
- Developing world applications of Raspberry Pi

### Implementation notes:
- May be able to generate our own images by photographing sprouting seeds (i.e. use various
beans, peas, and flower seeds as sample “crop” and “weed” plants as a training example)
- May identify low cost peristaltic pumps for applying liquid agents (example below)
